# WeatherProject

This project is crafted using a combination of HTML, CSS, Python Flask, and a limited use of JavaScript. 
The dataset, encapsulated in a JSON file, encompasses information related to sifted stations, with a selective subset employed due to the voluminous nature of the dataset. 
Weather data pertaining to the stations is organized according to the station name and date, exclusively for the year 2022.
To utilize alternative data, it is possible to incorporate it into the JSON file, adhering to the specific nomenclature outlined in the .gitignore file.
Should you encounter any challenges during the implementation or usage of this project, please feel free to reach out, and I will promptly assist you in resolving any issues.
